`meta-wpe` is a meta layer for [OpenEmbedded / Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) build environments.
It provides the necessary recipes to build the [WebPlatformforEmbedded](https://wpewebkit.org/) components including the WPE [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) browser.

* Documentation: <https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/meta-wpe/wiki>

## Quick Start

1. `git clone git@github.com:YoeDistro/yoe-distro.git` and `cd yoe-distro`
2. `. raspberrypi3-envsetup.sh` (OR any other machine with `. ./\<machine\>-envsetup.sh`)
3. `yoe_setup`
4. `yoe_add_layer git@github.com:WebPlatformForEmbedded/meta-wpe master
5. Add the following lines to `conf/local.conf` to build an eglfs image:
    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove_rpi = "x11"
    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove_rpi = "wayland"

    Note: If you want to build a Wayland based image, don't remove Wayland.
6. Build an full screen EGL image: `bitbake wpe-eglfs-image`.
7. Insert SD card
8. lsblk (note sd card device, and substitute for /dev/sdX below)
9. yoe_install_image /dev/sdX wpe-eglfs-image
10. Install SD card in a Raspberry PI and enjoy your new image

Note: If you do not want to use docker to build the image, please set `export DOCKER_REPO=none` prior to running the bitbake step.

Please visit the [documentation](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/meta-wpe/wiki) for detailed instructions, including tutorials and HowTo's for different devices for WPE.

For more information on the core Distro please visit [Yoe docs](https://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro/blob/master/docs/README.md)

## Usage

The image will start WPEFramework through the chosen init system, which will in turn start the WPEWebKit Browser and point it to a local index.html. You should see a Hello page with the IP of the device. There is no need to login to the device and start the browser manually.

WPEFramework loads several plugins, including a webserver and the wpewebkit browser. A locally supplied user interface is available to interact with the WPEFramework web services. All interactions with the browser and other plugins are available through web APIs. 

To interact with the browser:

1. Find the IP of the device on the welcome page
2. Navigate to the IP of the box with a browser to open the control UI
3. Open the WebKit Browser tab and set a new URL in the input field

All keys that are typed when the control page in focus are forwarded to the device. Alternatively you can also hookup USB remotes/keyboards.

### Change default URL

To make WPEFramework load another URL by default there are two ways:

* Set the startup URL at build time
* Modify the config on the device after you've build the image

#### Build time

To change the URL at build time, set the following variable in your `local.conf`:

```
WEBKITBROWSER_STARTURL = "http://www.github.com"
```

Rebuild your image as explained in the Quick start section. 


#### Runtime

Or change the local configuration:

```
$ vi /etc/WPEFramework/plugins/WebKitBrowser.json
```

In the JSON file, edit the URL key/value. Save and restart the box or reload WPEFramework through systemctl or sysinit. Alternatively we can access the service controller from host using IP displayed on the HDMI screen.

To change what WPEFramework loads, such as turn on/off plugins or interact with the service through another way please see the [WPEFramework](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/meta-wpe/wiki/WPEFramework) page on our wiki.
